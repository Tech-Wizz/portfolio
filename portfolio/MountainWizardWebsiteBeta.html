    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Mountain Wizard Website was created as the official online presence for my small business,
        <strong>Mountain Wizard LLC</strong>. Its purpose was to showcase the woodworking and handcrafted items 
        I produced, while giving customers a simple, clean platform to view offerings, learn about the company,
        and get in touch.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site was fully hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, making it cost‑effective, version‑controlled,
        and easy to update. Product sales were handled through Etsy, with website links directing customers to the
        appropriate product listings for checkout.
