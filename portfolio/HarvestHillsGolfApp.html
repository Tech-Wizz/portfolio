        <h1>Stage 1: Empathize—Research Your Users' Needs</h1>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The issue that I am trying to solve is making a golf app that is free 
            to use and can be used in most scenarios on a golf course. 
            The scenarios I want to cover are more regular play, tournament play, 
            and league play.</p>
        <h2>Recruitment Strategy</h2>
        <p>My recruit strategy was to find people, directly and indirectly, focused 
            on how connected people would be with the app. For the directly involved 
            I tried to find people more engaged with the course as a local or regular 
            golfer. By this I had someone I knew who was on the golf board and did 
            tournaments and leagues. Another directly involved type of person I did 
            was they are familiar with but are not as competitive. The more indirect 
            people I ask were those who know golf or aren’t familiar. This one was a 
            little easier because I could go ask engineering students for this part. 
            My main goal was to get a few people familiar with the issue and then try 
            and get a diverse opinion on the issue.</p>
        <h2>Interviewing Strategy</h2>
        <p>For my interview strategy, I used the approach of getting to know the other 
            person briefly by finding out information about local status, golf status, 
            and everyday devices. Similar to how a car can show people their personality
            , their phone can also say the same. After finding out this information I 
            can then ask for more specific details that are included on other golf apps 
            or missing from other golf apps</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Here with the empathy maps, I found some more unexpected results in this. A
             lot of people seemed to have a lot more interest in golf than I thought
              they would have. Like my sister was one of these and she hasn't ever had
               an interest until recently. Other where I thought they would be more for
                the app and less about golf were surprisingly the opposite of what I
                 originally had thought.</p>


        
        <h1>Stage 2: Define-State Your Users' Needs ad Problems</h1>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>For this, I decided to use Austin for the persona. This is due to his
             relationship with the golf course and not being in a position where
              his action will affect the public view of the golf course. With 
              that in mind, I also wanted to pick him more for his experience in
               what he has participated in, high school golf, and league. Also 
               with his age and what he has been through technology has been 
               more a part of his life than most generations.</p>

            <img src="../images/projects/golfapp/stage2/persona.png" alt="Persona">
        </div>
        <h2>Business Model Canvas</h2>
        <p>With the business model, I wanted to more look at what are my core 
            values toward the app or what I want to gain. With most of the sections
             in this, I want to this focus on the game specifically. For that reason
             , I want to make golf easier to play so I have to focus on where people 
             will need the game to be easier. This would result in the competition so
              that is where the key partners come in. With this, I can focus on groups
               that will be affected by the app in general which would be golfers. The
                one thing that is a little more difficult than I specifically wanted
                 for the app was a nondisrupted revenue stream. When you have to pay a
                  subscription most people will not use the app and the alternative is
                   to have ads which even get very irritating. My vision for this is to
                    do something similar in that movies do add sponsors or adds hidden
                     inside the app. All in all the business model is very 
                     straightforward without business knowledge.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage2\businessmodel.png" alt="Business Model Canvas">
        </div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>With stage two I found a lot of specific details that I overlooked. One 
            I honestly forgot to calculate into the app was the cost. It is a little 
            embarrassing but I guess that is more my personality of helping people 
            first rather than thinking of myself. Another part that I discovered is 
            my partners or target group. This wasn't too much of a surprise but it 
            was good to clarify how many I have and what they are. To focus on the 
            persona I learned more about what middle-aged people would feel about 
            this. One thing that I learned was the following trends which I don't like
             doing. This was very interesting since golf is a very laid-back sport. 
             One thing I did clarify with the business model is revenue is the revenue 
             stream. With this I personally am against subscriptions and ads that break
              apart the user experience. After giving it some thought I want to focus 
              on something similar to ads in movies and that is where I want to focus 
              on income.</p>





        <h1>Stage 3: Ideate—Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas</h1>
        <p>The way I liked to generate ideas is to have a starting point. Similar to 
            how mind mapping starts. At that point, I try to write down as many ideas 
            that can connect to the one branching idea. A lot of ideas that I tried 
            writing down were ones that were already there but I still even when off 
            of those. One very unique one that I had put down was a golden club. This 
            is more of an old fashion thing that golf courses, or more particularly, 
            my golf course used to do. The rule was if you scored a Hole and One on 
            hole number 5 Dirkes, a company and Fairfield would buy you a golden 
            putter. The only reason I know about this is that my grandpa, Co-owner 
            of Dirkes agreed to do this when he sponsored the hole. Almost everyone 
            forgot about it till my younger brother ended up getting a hole and one 
            on that hole. What came first from this was having messages or confetti 
            similar to virtual minigolf games. In short, where one idea lies another 
            idea can grow off of that. Also, the way my mind generates ideas can be a 
            little different since a am a bit dyslexic.</p>
        <h2>Mind Maping</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage3\mindmap.png" alt="Mind Map">
        </div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>My findings with mind mapping are ideas can make new completely different 
            ideas. The one part that surprised me the most is slowly trickling into 
            an old fashion idea just by going off of newer or more present-day ideas. 
            I went from virtual golf to an old fashion contest that went away years 
            ago. It even worked very well and could potentially be implemented into 
            this app if I choose it to. Even besides that I ended up adding more ideas 
            because of this and it made a narrow mind of thinking able to wander off 
            of ideas.</p>

        <h2>Low-Fidelity</h2>

        <h2>Usability Heuristics</h2>
        <h3>1: VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS</h3>
        <p>This is done through adequately labeled pages for the user to understand
             what is happening. Most of the labeling is done for people with golf 
             experience in the understanding of the game. Other symbols are included 
             to be simplistic and easy to understand.</p>
        <h3>2: MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD.</h3>
        <p>Most of the words used are golf terms where the user will know what is meant if you know the games. 
            Other uses are pictures that revolve around familiar app icons or similar 
            that can be directed toward the functionality.</p>
        <h3>3: USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM</h3>
        <p>This is done by keeping the bar at the bottom of the app constantly there, 
            with the exception of the login screen. This makes it so users can return 
            to any part of the app they left off. There is also the added red x 
            button that I made for part of the app as a more formal approach that 
            people would recognize more and looks better than the bar for exiting.</p>
        <h3>4: CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS</h3>
        <p>This is one of the reasons why I have the bar at the bottom of the page 
            rather than flipping through different pages in the app. This makes it 
            more consistent and easier to use than flipping from something different.</p>
        <h3>5: ERROR PREVENTION</h3>
        <p>This one was a little easier to prevent since a lot of the functionality 
            of the app involves coding which is the design portion that we are still 
            working on and won't go past. To prevent most errors I tried to make sure 
            everything is linked correctly. I also added some red X on some to make it 
            easier to prevent errors for transitions.</p>
        <h3>6: RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL</h3>
        <p>With this, I tried to add more icons that people were more likely to 
            recognize. Like a house for a home page, a person for a profile, and a 
            gear for settings. Even a pencil for entering your score. All of these are 
            common icons that people are more likely to recognize rather than remember.</p>
        <h3>7: FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE</h3>
        <p>The red X is a great example of what could be done or you can just go to 
            the bottom when you are done reading or entering information. Either way, 
            it can be used and still come with the same outcome and it would be up to 
            the user.</p>
        <h3>8: AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST</h3>
        <p>With this, I tried to take out as much information overload as I could. 
            Like adding multiple people to a scorecard. I personally have tried this 
            with other apps and it gets a bit confusing. With aesthetics, I tried to 
            keep a constant theme like using the bar at the bottom of the page. I even 
            matched the app to the logo that I built specifically for it and kept the 
            color scheme to use throughout the app.</p>
        <h3>9: HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS</h3>
        <p>Most of the app is pretty simplistic and this would be difficult till some 
            coding can be done to make the app more usable. Since it is simple it would 
            be easier to see when something is off or not working properly. The best 
            part to help with this issue would be going to help in setting up every 
            other app or use the contact in the app store. Any errors should not affect 
            users to the degree of not being able to golf.</p>
        <h3>10: HELP AND DOCUMENTATION</h3>
        <p>This is located in the setting like most apps and can be easily found in 
            the settings. This is included for common issues that would appear after 
            the use of the app by users, or issues that come up in testing.</p>
        <h2>UX Laws</h2>
        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
        <p>I tried to use Hick's Law when designing my app. I tried to take away as 
            many complicated steps as I could. This is without oversimplifying where 
            I could only have one decision per page which would make it more annoying 
            to use. Also, I tried to set it up in a way where you could gradually 
            introduce yourself to features and not get forced into things like most 
            applications do to try and make sure you understand that app completely 
            which can be exciting.</p>
        <h3>Law of Common Region</h3>
        <p>With this, I tried to make a basic area defined by a box that does not 
            disappear. This is the bar at the bottom of the screen. This makes common 
            ground for the navigation adding structure to the app where a user can be 
            comfortable. I have seen apps that switch bars or completely get rid of a 
            bar during a function. This panics the user and oftentimes confuses them.</p>
        <h3>Miller's Law</h3>
        <p>As stated an average person can keep 5-9 items in their memory. That is why 
            I tried to add 5 distinct categories to the bar. With this, I can organize 
            different functionalities into this. Doing the app this way makes the app 
            easier to use and memorize. Also by making more memorable icons, it also 
            works off of prior knowledge and makes it easier to understand in the long 
            run.</p>



        <h1>Stage 5: Test—Try Out Your Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Background Summary</h2>
        <p>Here I wanted to test how comfortable users would be with my app. Since 
            the app is focused on a local population, I wanted to have local people 
            test the app. The way I had people test it was remotely. So I used a google 
            form with steps for the user to test out functionality. I would also call 
            and talk to the people testing the app to make sure everything was working 
            correctly and that they understood what task I was asking of them. The one 
            thing I was worried about with the prototype was the devices people were 
            using with adobe XD, because the solution for the phone I chose, and the 
            people I was interviewing all had different phones.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage5\methodology.png" alt="Usability Test Plan Dashboard">
        </div>
        <h2>Test Results</h2>
        <p>With the results, I used python to generate answers and graphs to the data 
            that I collected. The code that I used to calculate these answers is 
            located in my GitHub repository for this class.</p>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage5\code.png" alt="Code">

        <p>Here is the code I used</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Tech-Wizz/CSCI-443/blob/main/uidesign.py">CSCI 443 GitHub</a>
        <h3>Mean</h3>
        <p>With python, I wanted to get the mean of each task I had the tester complete. 
            With this I get a better representation of the functionality overall.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage5\mean.png" alt="Mean">
        </div>
        <h3>Standard Deviation</h3>
        <p>With the standard deviation, I was able to see how far I was from getting 
            a perfect score from my testers. The closer I got to 1 this meant I need 
            to work on it and the closer I got to 0 means the more it was very 
            simplistic and easy for the user to understand.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage5\standarddeviation.png" alt="Standard Deviation">
        </div>
        <h3>Graphs</h3>
        <p>With both of the graphs that I used there is a certain meaning behind each 
            one that I wanted to take away from data science and statics. The first 
            chart is the classic bar graph I wanted to show the differences between 
            each tester. As I mentioned before I wanted the testers to be local or 
            familiar with the golf course I am specifically targeting for the app. The 
            other part is having a very diverse group. This ranges from having 2 
            females (left 2) and 3 males. Others would be an age where the two in 
            the middle (Kari and Chris) are in their 40s and the rest are in their 20s. 
            There are also the two on the edges who are less familiar with the golf 
            course due to one being from another town(Morgan from Helena) and the other 
            being from another country(Libien from Hati). With all of these taken into 
            account, it is very interesting to see more diverse opinions to potentially 
            fix the app to meet all their needs.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../\images\projects\golfapp\stage5\bar.png" alt="Graph 1">
        </div>
        <p>With the box plot, I wanted to see if I could detect any outliers. This 
            will help get rid of some potential human error when it comes to testing 
            or just seeing someone with a very different perspective. I wanted to run 
            this plot due to the last survey I sent to people having an outlier that I 
            personally noticed and it was one of the people I surveyed who filled in 
            the answers backward due to repetitively answering surveys in the opposite 
            direction I had. I learned this technique in stats to potentially find 
            errors in the data.</p>

        <h2>Findings and Recommendation</h2>
        <p>First off when having a user test my app out I found out the hard way, but I learned adobe xd is not compatible with my word and grammar checker for my dyslexia. One of my testers pointed out that I had a lot of misspelled words. That is one issue I would need to fix when finalizing the app and I would involve more testers or just auditors.</p>
        <p>Another issue I ran into and had to help guide some of the testers through was the login page. I probably should not have one till the app is complete but in my mind, I wanted a way to save the personal profile and league placing. Since it was a prototype and didn't have functionality as a login page I confused half my tester into thinking it was real. That is why the first bar for most of the testers is so low.</p>
        <p>The one that got the most positive feedback was the profile because of the easily recognized symbol. This surprised me because the gear is more recognized as a setting symbol but it confused a tester.</p>
        <p>The one thing that I would recommend is finding a way to make my prototype fit the screen of the user/tester. This is because testers had to scroll when testing. I got a little ahead of myself for wanting all smartphone types able to use the app. From the first survey, I should have used the phone type data and taken that, and I should have asked for the model as well.</p>
